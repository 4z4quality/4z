                Welcome to the <span>4Z-Pedia</span>. Many countries consider education as a part of its national security. Education is what raises the leaders of the society, its scholars, protectors, teachers, doctors, engineers, etc. So, let's learn more about accreditation of educational institutions, that ensures quality education for every individual in the society<br>
                <hr>
                <h2>Quality Education:</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A <span>quality education</span> is one that focuses on the whole student; the social, emotional, mental, physical, and cognitive development of each student regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or geographic location.</li>
                    <li>A <span>quality education</span> provides resources and directs policy to ensure that each student enters schooln or university healthy and learns about and practices a healthy lifestyle; learns in an environment that is physically and emotionally safe for students and teachers; is actively engaged in learning and is connected to the school or university and broader community; has access to personalized learning and is supported by qualified, caring teachers; and is challenged academically and prepared for success in college or further study and for employment and participation in a global environment.</li>
                    <li>A <span>quality education</span> provides the outcomes needed for individuals, communities, and societies to prosper.</li>
                    <li>A <span>quality education</span> allows schools or universities to align and integrate fully with their communities and access a range of services across sectors designed to support the educational development of their students.</li>
                    <li>A <span>quality education</span> is supported by 3 key pillars: ensuring access to quality teachers; providing use of quality learning tools and professional development; and the establishment of safe and supportive quality learning environments.</li>
                    <li>A <span>quality education</span> should prepare students for LIFE, with all its current complexities, not just prepare them for EXAMS.</li>
                  </ul>
                <hr>
                <div class="quote"><i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-left quote-icon-left"></i> A quality education should prepare students for LIFE, with all its current complexities, not just prepare them for EXAMS. <a title="4Z official Website" href="https://the4z.com/">4Z for Quality</a> knows this well, and this is the essence of what it offers to its valued customers <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right"></i></div>

                <h2>Educational Accreditation:</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span>Educational accreditation</span> is the process of evaluation and verification of the quality of services and operations of any educational institution, or program by an external body. In order to determine whether applicable and recognized standards are met. If standards are fulfilled, accreditation is granted.</li>
                    <li>To be <span>accredited</span>, schools, institutes or universities must undertake an extensive process that requires them to successfully pass quality indicators as: manage accurate data, design high-standard courses, carry out periodical assessments to evaluate and enhance performance of students, provide top-level facilities, teaching aids, etc.</li>
                    <li><span>Educational accreditation</span> is performed in most countries by a governmental organization, usually the ministry of education.</li>
                    <li>In <span>USA</span>, the government delegates instead the accreditation to private, non-profit organizations (accreditors), all accreditors in USA must in turn be recognized by the national advisory committee on institutional quality and integrity (NACIQI), which is a body of the U.S. ministry of education. That means that also in the US, accreditation is indirectly controlled by the government.</li>
                  </ul>
                <hr>
                <h2>Purposes of the Accreditation:</h2>

Results of educational outcomes are readily available and used in planning for change and enhancing the program.</li>
                    <li><span>Planning and Improvement</span>: accredited institutions are encouraged to plan, where needed, for change and for improving the learning environment. institutions anticipate and address change in a timely and methodical manner. Student achievement is stressed.</li>
                  </ol>
                <hr>

                    <li>The <span>public</span> can be assured that accredited programs are evaluated and inspected extensively and conform to the expectations of education.</li>
                    <li><span>Students</span> can identify and choose programs that meet quality standards of education.</li>
                    <li><span>Institutions</span> benefit from the self-evaluation and program improvement provided by the accreditation process and earn credibility.</li>
                    <li>Any <span>profession</span> benefit from crucial input into the standards established for its future professionals.</li>
                  </ol>

                <h2>Steps of educational Accreditation:</h2><br>
                <img src="../assets/img/pedia/edu.webp" alt="Steps of Educational Accreditation" title="Steps of Educational Accreditation" width="1288" height="600" class="img-fluid"><br><br>
                  <ol>
                    <li><span>Self-assessment</span>: the institution that seeks an accreditation, should perform a self-assessment to its operational processes according to the relevant local or international standards. This can be done by their own staff, or with the help of an external quality consulting agency, like <a title="4Z official Website" href="https://the4z.com/">4Z for Quality</a>.</li>
                    <li><span>Application for the accreditation</span>: the institution applies for the accreditation and signs an agreement with the accrediting body.</li>
                    <li><span>Eligibility verification of the accreditation</span>: the accrediting body examines documents sent by the institution (proof of compliance to the educational standards set forth by the accreditation body), and a review report is sent back to the institution.</li>
                    <li><span>Site-visit</span>: the accrediting body assign reviewers (number of reviewers varies according to the size of the institution and number of programs). Then, a visit schedule is set up in coordination with the institution. Site-visit is executed, in which, interviews are conducted with students and staff. Facilities and equipment are inspected, and documents are examined.</li>
                    <li><span>Review report</span>: after the site-visit, reviewers submit an initial report draft, that will be verified by consultants. Then, a copy with improvement recommendations, if any, is sent to the institution.</li>
                    <li><span>Accreditation decision</span>: if the institution fulfils the requirement, a final report is issued to recommend accreditation. The accreditation status of the institution is then announced.</li>
                    <li><span>Periodic follow-up</span>: the institution prepares an annual report on its status, and efforts made to implement any recommendations of the accrediting body. Subsequently, the accrediting body examines the report, make a site-visit to the institution (if needed), and issues a follow-up report and send it to the institution. This ensures that the institution continue to adhere to high standards after initially earning accreditation.</li>
