                Welcome to the <span style="color: #FF8000">4Z-Pedia</span>. Many people are asking how to get an ISO certification. We explained in another <a href="iso-9001.html">4Z-Pedia</a> document, the various <a href="iso-9001.html">steps of ISO 9001:2015 certification</a>. But before thinking in contacting a certifying body, it is helpful to know how close you are from the qualification to a formal ISO 9001:2015 certification.
                <br><br><span class="border-line2"></span> 
                <br><br>We prepared the following checklist as a guide for that purpose. Please note that this <b>checklist</b> is composed of questions & three possible answers.
                <br><br><b>Questions</b> are based on the clauses of the international ISO 9001:2015 standard. They cover both <b>mandatory</b> & <b>commonly used</b> clauses required by any ISO certifying body.
                <br><br>Answers are divided into <b>three</b> distinct categories:
                  <ol>
                          <li><span style="color: #FF8000">Ready</span>: means that you can proof your fulfilment of these clauses by appropriate documentation, thereby ready for the visit of the external audit by the certifying body.</li>
                          <li><span style="color: #FF8000">Almost Ready</span>: means that you are ready for the visit of the external audit by the certifying body to inspect you. But you need a small support to complete the required documentation.</li>
                          <li><span style="color: #FF8000">Not Really</span>: means that you need extensive preparation before getting ready for the visit of the external audit by the certifying body to inspect you.</li>
                  </ol>
                <br>At the end of this checklist, you will find further guidance on what to do depending on your answers.
                <br><br><div class="quote"><i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-left quote-icon-left"></i> In each question you will be asked whether you think you have fulfilled the criteria of the standard. You have the choice to answer as: Ready, Almost Ready, or Not Really <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right"></i></div>
                <br><span class="border-line2"></span>
                <br><h2 style="text-align: center;">Readiness Checklist</h2>
                <br>Please note that cells in (<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Red</span>) are mandatory documents, while cells in (<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Blue</span>) are commonly used non-mandatory documents.<br><br>
